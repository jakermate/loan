# Car Loan Calculator

## Motivation
The goal with this poroject was to build a straightforward loan calculator to help potential new or used car buyers budget for their purchase.
I wanted to include as much visual feedback as possible to help demonstrate how big of a difference factors like interest rates and loan duration can have on the overall amount someone will be paying throughout the life of the loan.

## Project Goals
- Clean and modern UI for ease of use and legibility.
- Simplified outputs (no decimals or erroneous information).
- Responsive layout.
